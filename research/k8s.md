# Kubernetes in Banking: Overview and Best Practices

## 🚀 What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It abstracts infrastructure, providing a consistent environment to run and manage workloads reliably and efficiently.

## 🏦 Role of Kubernetes in Banking

Modern banking systems require high reliability, scalability, security, and regulatory compliance. Kubernetes helps banks achieve these by:

- Supporting **microservices architecture**.
- Enabling **scalability and elasticity** during workload peaks.
- Providing **resilience and high availability**.
- Maintaining consistent environments across development, staging, and production.
- Meeting **security and compliance** requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR, LGPD).
- Facilitating hybrid and multi-cloud strategies.

Example use cases:

- Payments services handling transaction surges.
- Fraud detection systems scaling independently and securely.

## ✅ Best Practices for Kubernetes in Regulated Industries

### 🔒 1. Security-first posture

Security is paramount in banking:

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Apply least privilege, minimizing broad cluster-admin permissions.
- **Network Policies**: Restrict pod-to-pod communication and isolate sensitive services.
- **Secrets Management**: Use secure storage for secrets (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of plain-text ConfigMaps.
- **Image security**: Scan container images for vulnerabilities and use pinned, trusted versions.
- **Pod Security Standards (PSS)**: Prevent containers from running as root, enforce restricted privilege settings.

### 🔍 2. Audit and compliance

Regulatory requirements demand traceability:

- Enable and securely store **Kubernetes Audit Logs** for actions performed in the cluster.
- Adopt **GitOps workflows** to version-control infrastructure and application configurations for auditability.
- Align practices with **compliance frameworks** such as PCI DSS, ISO 27001, or SOC 2.

### 🔗 3. Identity and Access Management (IAM) integration

- Integrate Kubernetes with **enterprise identity providers** (LDAP, Active Directory, OIDC).
- Prefer **short-lived credentials or tokens** over static credentials to reduce exposure risk.

### 🖧 4. Networking and encryption

- Use **TLS/mTLS for pod-to-pod and service-to-service communication**.
- Ensure **encryption at rest** for persistent storage.
- Protect network traffic in **hybrid and multi-region deployments**.

### ⚙️ 5. Reliability and disaster recovery

High availability and disaster recovery are essential:

- Deploy clusters across **multiple availability zones** to tolerate zone failures.
- Regularly back up **etcd and persistent volumes**.
- Define **PodDisruptionBudgets** to minimize accidental disruption to critical services.

### 📈 6. Observability and monitoring

Banks must ensure real-time visibility and monitoring:

- **Centralized logs** using ELK stack or managed logging services.
- Collect and visualize **metrics with Prometheus and Grafana**.
- Implement **distributed tracing** for debugging across microservices.
- Configure **alerting and escalation paths** for critical incidents.

### 🔒 7. Data residency and locality

- Respect **data sovereignty laws** by ensuring sensitive data is stored and processed in approved regions.
- Enforce locality via **regional clusters or namespace policies**.

### ⚡ 8. Change management

- Use **Blue/Green and Canary deployments** to minimize risks during releases.
- Automate deployment pipelines with appropriate **approval workflows for production changes**.

### 🔧 9. Operational governance

Strong governance ensures consistent operations:

- Maintain an up-to-date **inventory of workloads running in Kubernetes**.
- Define and monitor **Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs)** for key services.
- Document **runbooks and escalation procedures** for production teams.

### 🔔 10. Vendor and supply chain hardening

- Only allow **trusted container images from verified registries**.
- Enforce policies using **admission controllers (e.g., OPA, Kyverno)** to block insecure or non-compliant workloads.
- Regularly perform **vulnerability scanning at both infrastructure and workload levels**.
